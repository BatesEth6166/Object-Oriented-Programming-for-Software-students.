### By Ethan Bates
This repository was created to complete Exercise 3-2 in CSCI 1106 and serve as a resume of sorts when applying for job.
I am Ethan Bates, oldest of 10 children I enjoy reading, solving puzzles and engaging in competetive team based events with friends.
I seek to gain a career in the ever expanding field of computer science and programming. A career I can use to work from home and to buy a home where I can raise a faimly and live happily ever after.
